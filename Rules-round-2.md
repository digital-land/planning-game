# Round 2: Growing Your Town (20mins)

Create an **Investment Plan** to meet your community's needs, the development priorities you've identified, and your policies. 

**DO NOT MOVE YOUR TILES.**

You have an investment budget of £500

* You cannot build on roads or water
* You can expand your town outside the existing footprint (increase your town tiles) for £20 per time, in addition to any development costs.
* You can build over brownfield sites at a cost of £0
* Some developments come with Developer Contributions, which you can use to help fund other developments.

**DON'T** make any changes to your original town (i.e. don’t move your tiles)
**DO** crunch the numbers on the impact of your investment decisions by updating your potential housing, jobs, environment and health & well-being scores.
**AND Remember** the rules of an ideal town

### Create an Investment Plan that answers:

**The town’s needs, with the new plan**

* How many jobs would you have vs how many do you need?
* How many school places would you have vs how many do you need?
* What are the overall Environment and Health & well-being scores for your town? 

**Improving your town** 

* What observations, decisions and compromises are you making?
* Are you following any policies you made?
* How would you be meeting the development priorities you set out?
