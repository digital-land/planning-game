# Round 3: New Mayor, new priorities (20 mins)

A new regional mayor has been elected. They want to make their mark, so they have new priorities they want all towns to meet. This presents a new challenge for you to adapt your strategies and meet these new priorities.

## Mayoral priorities
Speaking from their new offices in the Inner City, the mayor said:

*“I am excited about the potential of making our region the greatest area in the country.
We’ll need to collaborate across our towns to build 500 new households, improve our community’s health & well-being and meet our 2025 goals of net zero environmental scores.
I believe it’s possible to do this whilst maintaining enough job opportunities and school places in our region.
(I also really want at least one new golf course.)”*

### Review your investment plan
Update your investment plan based on the mayoral regional priorities balanced with your town’s needs.

You can trade school places, jobs and some of your environment and health & well-being points with other towns. 

Assign a **chief negotiator** to visit other towns and trade.

Remember that you must pay for developments and to increase your town’s footprint.

**Update your investment plan. Do not swap your tiles with other towns.**

Remember that trades will reduce your town’s scores, so consider what you trade.
