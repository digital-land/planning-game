# Round 4: Create Your Local Plan (20mins)

It’s time to create your local plan based on your previous decisions. After this round, you will present it to the rest of the room.

---

### On flipchart, summarise your plan 

Use the following six headings:

1. Housing
2. Transport and infrastructure
3. Economic development (jobs/training/education)
4. Environmental sustainability
5. Funding
6. Community health & well-being

Create realistic examples that demonstrate how your plan:

* meets planning guidelines
* uses data to inform decision-making
* approaches community engagement
* Show your community’s needs through numbers (jobs, school places, Environment and Health & well-being)
