## Who is it for

Anyone can play. You don’t need anyone with knowledge of planning but it’s fun the play it with planners.

## The format

It should include:

1. Introduction to planning
2. Introduction to the game mechanics
3. Four 20-minute rounds
4. Presentations
5. Group voting
6. Awards

## The four rounds

### Round 1: Make your town (20 mins)

In this round, teams will create and name their towns. 

They will learn more about the needs of their community and start to gather ideas about improving their towns.

[Round 1 rules](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-game/blob/main/Rules-round-1.md).

### Round 2: Growing your town (20 mins)

In this round, teams will create an investment plan to meet their community’s needs, the development priorities they have identified, and their policies. 

[Round 2 rules](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-game/blob/main/Rules-round-2.md).

### Round 3: New mayor, new priorities (20 mins)

A new regional mayor has been elected. They want to make their mark, so they have new priorities they want all towns to meet. This presents a new challenge for the teams to adapt their strategies and meet these new priorities.

### Round 4: Create your local plan (20 mins)

It’s time for teams to create a local plan for their town based on their previous decisions. After this round, they will present it to the rest of the room.
